    <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>

    <h3> Unfinished and biased datasets for Artificial Intelligence, 
      (AI) facial recognition and expression analysis models, create 
      real world cases of discrimination against those people who are 
      not equally represented in the training dataset. Current AI models do not perform equally
      and have exposed racial biases in their training data.

      This website, developed with the p5.js and p5.play Javascript libraries,
      is a metaphor for the experience of being unrecognised or misslabelled by AI.
